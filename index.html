        <h2 id="headline"> Memories we shared while in Japan </h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Arrival</strong> - Before we even arrived in Japan, we all met up in the Chicago airport and flew together to Taiwan for a layover. This is where we got our first taste of authentic aisan culture. We had a lot of fun hangning around the "Hello Kitty" section of the airport</li>
          <li><strong>Nichijou (Everyday Life) </strong> - Getting to spend every day on campus together was a real treat. We would hang around in the Global Lounge together and meet new people, not only from Japan but from other countries as well!</li>
          <li><strong>Osaka</strong> - One of the first trips we took was around Colin's birthday where we went to Osaka, DenDen, and Dontonburi where we ate horse tongue before reitring to a Torikizoku for a celabratory drink!</li>
          <li><strong>Kyoto</strong> - was a bit of an unexpected trip as it was planned by one of our Japanese friends, but it was quite a bit of fun! We climibed a mountain to feed monkeys, saw a panda in a bamboo forest, and took a foot bath.</li>
          <li><strong>Tokyo</strong> - This trip was a couple weeks in the making. Between going to Ueno park, Akihabara, Shibuya, Asakusa shrine, and the Tokyo Tower, needless to say the trip wore us out. Luckily we didn't get lost (like in future trips) </li>
          <li><strong>Nara</strong> - Before going to Nara, I couldn't remember the last time I was in a city and walked up to an animal without it running away. Instead in Nara if you walked up to an animal, it would bow in front of you to get some of the food you were eating. Just try not to wrestle the deer.</li>
          <li><strong>End of the Journey</strong> - It was very sad to leave Japan. I feel like I can speak for the squad when I say I feel like I left apart of myself behind. We will always look back on this time fondly and hopefully we can all meet up there once again.
        </ul>
